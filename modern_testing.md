# Ministry of Testing - Modern testing - WIP NOTES

## Agile vs modern testing

- Agile
  - test specialist on feature team
  - works primarily on testing tasks needed for feature / product quality
- Modern
  - Not necessarily a role (but often is the test specialist of the team)
  - Data-driven and customer obsessed
  - Passionate about efficiency

## Principles

1. Our priority is improving the business.
2. We accelerate the team, and use models like Lean Thinking and the Theory of Constraints to help identify, prioritize and mitigate bottlenecks from the system.
3. We are a force for continuous improvement, helping the team adapt and optimize in order to succeed, rather than providing a safety net to catch failures.
4. We care deeply about the quality culture of our team, and we coach, lead, and nurture the team towards a more mature quality culture.
5. We believe that the customer is the only one capable to judge and evaluate the quality of our product
6. We use data extensively to deeply understand customer usage and then close the gaps between product hypotheses and business impact.
7. We expand testing abilities and knowhow across the team; understanding that this may reduce (or eliminate) the need for a dedicated testing specialist

## One - our priority is improving the business

Modern testing:

- Be proactive
- Ask: how can we do this better
- Collaborate and help
- Adapt
- Listen to your Customers
- Try new things
- Focus on Problem Solving
- Always test - right testing at the right time, focus on efficiency

### One - Reflect

- List activities on the team and determine if they are perceived as a Cost or Value
- What are new things you can do to improve the business?
- What will you try on your team?

## Two - Accelerating the team

Theory of constraints

1. Identify constraints (bottlenecks)
2. Fix them
3. Measure and repeat (iterate)

Lean software

1. Eliminate waste
2. Build quality in
3. Create Knowledge
4. Defer commitment
5. Deliver fast
6. Respect people
7. Optimize the Whole

### Two - Reflect

- Biggest bottleneck in your release cycle? how would you mitigate it?
- List things that speed me up and slow me down
- Where is your waste?
- What activities in your release cycle are unnecessary or redundant?
- What activities do you do that help the team move faster or work through bottlenecks?

## Three - Continuous improvement

- Continuous improvement for people, process and tools
- Kaizen (change for the better in japanese) - from lean manufacturing, constant reflection and review, communication is critical
- Have good retros, assign action items to individuals, Reflect
- Talk to people
- Try things, then try more things
- Use Scientific method: observe, question, hypothesis, prediction, measure, iterate

### Three - Reflect

- What have you or your team done recently to improve?
- What do you think the next improvement should be?
- What do you think the other team members want to improve?

## Four - The quality culture

Shared mindset that delivering high quality software to customers is our top priority, and that all of our practices support this effort.
Put users first rather than focus on short term objectives

Software is changing:

- From multi year product cycles to shipping multiple times a day
- From separate test teams to embedded testers on a dev team, or no testers at all
- From Testers unofficially owning quality to "everyone" owning quality

Transition guide / Maturity model -> <http://bit.ly/QCTGuide>

- Four levels: chaos, growing, competent, optimizing

### Four - Reflect

List 1-3 reasons why you are well suited to lead the quality culture on your team

## Five - The customer is king

- You (dev team) are not the customer
- Customers don't want or care about software, they want their problems solved
- We want customer to tell us if we are solving their problem
- Balance fallacy of now (get something done now even if it's not ready) vs failure to launch -> deliver on the right time
- Feedback: talk to them, forums, data

## Five - Reflect

- How do you get feedback?
- What can you do to get more feedback?

## Six - Data

Use data for:

- Understand your customer and market fit
- Gain insights, make informed decisions
- Learn how customers use your product and make predictions about them

Data growth model

- Data Oblivious - intuition and customer feedback defines actions taken
- Data Affirmed - Data is only believed if it affirms intuition
- Data Driven - Intuition validated by data defined actions taken
- Data Centric - Data analysis is core to all decisions

Data collection

- Collect everything vs what you need
- Approaches
  - Success factor based: what data you need to assess if your feature is successful
  - Scenario based: what data do we need to tell if a use case is working for customers
  - Hypothesis based: tie analytics to business goals

### Six - Reflect

- Where is your organization on the data growth model
- How will you grow your data culture?
- What is some feedback that you could have discovered sooner by using data?

## Seven - Everyone can test

Elephant in the room: this may reduce or eliminate the need of dedicated testers -> only when the right level of maturity is reached

Transferring testing skills

- Brown bags and sharing sessions
- Pair Testing
- Ask about testing on a regular basis (scrum meetings, PRs)
- Tester role is to share expertise with the team

### Seven - Reflect

- What do you do (or will you do) to teach other team members to test?
- What would happen if the test team disappeared today?
  - what work would be picked up from others?
  - what work would be dropped?
  - what would happen to product quality and the customer experience?
- What would need to happen for the team to not depend on the tester
- What are some testing tasks you thing other team members can or should do?
- what activities do you want to do that you don't have time for?
